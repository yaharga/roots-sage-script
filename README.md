# roots-sage-script
This is an automation bash shell script for the creation of a WordPress instance with the Bedrock WordPress Boilerplate and Sage as its default theme.

# Planned Features
- Creating a Yeoman Generator to separate the possible commands to be placed into the generator and others that cannot be put into the genrator.
- Adding a MAMP and MAMP Pro automatic virtual host creation line.
- Adding a line to add the repository to the github GUI application.
- Creating a Windows version.
- Providing the option to set defaults in the file to choose a quick creation instead of being prompted for same input everytime.
